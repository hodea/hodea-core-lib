This file describes the coding style used for the HODEA library.

## Hungarian notation

X DO NOT use Hungarian notation.

The Hungarian notation [4] breaks abstraction and makes the code
unmaintainable. It is hard to read and the naming gets wrong over time.

[1], [2] discourage its use, and even the originator of the Hungarian
notation has banned it [5].
